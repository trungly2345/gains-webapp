suppose I want an webapp that records 10 records of the users -> experiemnt 
calculate the number of records for each entity model 
- user 
- excercise 
- workout 
- set 
- bodyweight_log 
- nutrition_log 


-> Things to consider 
 - what table joins with another table 
 - is it necessary to make table joins
 - for scalability, how can we optimize the database best way possible? -> (what to index, what to extract to the frontend? )
